  <h2>Return & Refund Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 23, 2025</p>

  <p>At The Cake Shop, every dessert is handmade with care and attention to detail. Because our products are perishable and custom-made, we have specific guidelines for returns and refunds.</p>

  <h3>Custom Orders & Cakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All custom orders are non-refundable once production has started.</li>
    <li>If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 24 hours of pick-up or delivery so we can evaluate and address the concern.</li>
    <li>We do not accept returns on custom cakes or desserts unless there was a clear error on our part (e.g., wrong design, flavor, or product).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pre-Orders & Cancellations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellations must be made at least 48 hours in advance for a full refund.</li>
    <li>Cancellations within 48 hours of pickup/delivery are non-refundable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In-Store Purchases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Due to health and safety regulations, all baked goods are final sale once they leave our store.</li>
    <li>If you're unsatisfied with your in-store purchase, please bring the item back the same day with proof of purchase so we can evaluate the issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Contact Us</h3>
  <p>We want every experience to be a sweet one. If something isn’t right, please contact us at <a href="mailto:thecakeshop@example.com">thecakeshop@example.com</a> or call (760) 946-5500, and we’ll do our best to make it right.</p>
